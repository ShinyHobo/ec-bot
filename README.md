## Usage
### Setup
Install Node 16.10.0+ (includes npm).

In the console, run the following commands, from the root directory after installing node 16.10.0+ (comes with npm):
1. `npm install`
2. `npm install -g ts-node`

If there are module conflicts, delete the node_modules folder and rerun the commands. 

### Discord Bot
If you want to use the Discord bot, you first need to add a .env file containing `TOKEN=[BOT TOKEN HERE]` to the root folder.

To run the Discord bot, execute the following commands in the console from the root directory:

`ts-node .\src\index.ts`

To run continuously and automatically restart after an error, I suggest using [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/).

### CLI
If you just want to run a specific command locally on the command line, you can use the CLI instead:

`ts-node .\src\index.ts <command>`

Note that commands in CLI are written without the '!' as prefix:

`ts-node .\src\index.ts roadmap pull`

The commands `verify` and `renew` are not available when using the CLI.
